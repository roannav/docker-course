# Learn Docker

Source code for hello-docker, react-docker and vite-project are from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFgJkfScVNU .

I also created basic MERN and Next.js projects that use Docker.  These are different from the video tutorial above.

# Naming convention

- compose.yaml (preferred name for Docker Compose v2+)
- docker-compose.yml (originally from Docker Compose v1, but it also works for v2.)
